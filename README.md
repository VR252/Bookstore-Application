# Bookstore-Application

This application was created using javascript while the visuals were created with JavaFX. This application stores account credentails (both "customer" and admin)
along with books available for purchase. The admin account (user: admin ; password: admin) allows the managment of active accounts (i.e customers) and management
of books available for purchase. The customer account (ex, user: jimmy ; password: 12345) has features that allow browsing and purchase of books with or without 
account points.
